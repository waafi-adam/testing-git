    <p>[git init] - intitialize as git repo <br>
        [git add .] - add files to staging area <br>
        <!-- you can do in your terminal "git add index.html" or you can just do "git add ." to add everything from the project folder -->
        [git commit -m "initial commit"] - commit
        <br><br> once you have initialised a file into git hub as a repostiatry you can make some changes and push it into git hub again as a different commit so it wont change affect you had made before, example as seen below: <br>
        git push . <br>
        git commit -m "background changed to red" <br>
        git push -u origin master
